            I value this quote from our class greatly as it helps answer how our future lives will be. 
            Without the activities, the things or people that we are passionate about, 
            we are more likely to succumb to dread and nothingness, leading to a future of misery.
            In order to retain our youngness, we must try our best to maintain the things we love, 
            and through them, we can stay young forever.

            "He was in despair." <br />
            "What about?"  <br />
            "Nothing."   <br />
            "How do you know it was nothing? He has plenty of money."  <br />
          </h1>
          <p>
            This quote from ACWLP resonated with me as it shows that money can't get you out of the void of "nothingness."
            Money can realistically only keep you away from that void by allowing you to spend more time with the thing,
            person, or activity that you love. But if you lose them, only you can find a way to come back or discover 
            something new to fill that void.
