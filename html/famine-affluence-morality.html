            "Most of these problems are not caused by the common person and instead are caused by an oligarchy
            of power and wealth holders which only care for their self interest. In order to finally break 
            free from this circle donation and poverty we must hold the countries, companies and wealth 
            holders accountable for these events."
          </h1>
          <p>
            This quote is super important right now as we are seeing a rise in the concentration of power 
            and money towards a small group of people and companies, which in turn cause many of these problems.
            In order to stop them from using their power in a corrupt and destructive manner,
            they must be held accountable, and when they are, we can stop the cycle of
            poverty and exploitation.

            "It follows from what I have said earlier that we ought to give money away, 
            rather than spend it on clothes which we do not need to keep us warm. 
            To do so is not charitable, On the contrary, we ought to give the money away,
            and it is wrong not to do so.
          </h1>
          <p>
            A lot of our society is influenced by consumerism and overconsumption of unnecessary goods, 
            and I personally have never liked this attribute of our society. This is why I value this quote, 
            and I agree with the fact that we shouldn't waste money on materialistic goods and instead use it 
            for something good or an investment. Or at the very least, instead, use it for experiences that we
            can remember and cherish.
