            "As photographs give people an imaginary possession of a past that is unreal, they 
            also help people to take possession of space in which they are insecure. Photos are 
            essentially a map: they are a way of displaying space."
          </h1>
          <p>
            I remember before reading this quote; In my geopolitics class, we talked about maps and the 
            various types of maps. I was kind of surprised when my teacher mentioned photographs as being 
            a type of map, but it made a lot of sense. Photographs help us map out a time or space and makes
            them more accessible and concrete. A really cool feature that Google Photos has is an ability to
            view a map where all your photos were taken. This makes a map of NYC feel much more personal 
            and also much more concrete.

            "To set aside the sympathy we extend to others beset by war and murderous politics for a
            reflection on how our privileges are located on the same map as their suffering, 
            ... , as the wealth of some may imply the destitution of others, is a task for which the painful, 
            stirring images supply only an initial spark."
          </h1>
          <p>
            This quote resonated with me as I grew up in a poor North-African country. When I immigrated here, 
            my family would always watch the news from our home country, and I would always see the issues 
            that were happening back there. I felt that "initial spark" that the quote talked about but I 
            couldn't do much except realize the privilege that I was able to immigrate here.
