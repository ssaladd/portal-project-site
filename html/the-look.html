            "Someone is looking at me. What does this mean? It means that I am suddenly affected in my being and that essential 
            modifications appear in my structure - modifications which I can apprehend and fix conceptually 
            by means of the reflective cogito."

          <p>
            This quote is relevant as it is applicable in daily life when we interact with others.
            It highlights how much we care about others' opinion; we want to portray ourselves in the best way possible, 
            sometimes even trying to portray ourselves in unrealistic standards. 
            It is important to realize that we don't need to be the best of the best and to be continually 
            changing ourselves for others and instead, realize it is okay to be imperfect.

            "you recognize that there is another point of view on things, a point of view that ON PRINCIPLE 
            you can never occupy. All of a sudden, the world comes on to you as referring not just to your point 
            of view, but to another one too"
          </h1>
          <p>
            This quote is humbling as it reminds you that the world does not revolve around you and that other
            people in the world go on with their lives just like you. But we usually forget about that until 
            "the look" happens to you. This makes "the look" another kind of necessary thing we need in our world 
            if we are to keep acknowledging the lives of others and if we are to become better socially.
