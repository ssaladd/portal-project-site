            "The dread directs you towards the things that are slipping out of meaning 
            by edging you into a world without them, and pulling you back."
          </h1>
          <p>
            I wrote this quote because it reflected what happened to me during quarantine/lockdown.
            I was essentially dipped into a world without the "somethings" I value. 
            I couldn't play soccer, couldn't see my friends, do various activities, etc. And as a result, 
            I felt a bit of dread, which in turn made me realize how valuable these things were. And 
            that realization renewed my passions for those things I valued.

           "The nothing is not an object, and it is no thing at all. The nothing 
            does not show up for itself, nor does it show up “next to” things as if it were attached to them. 
            Rather, the nothing is what makes it possible for anything to be meaningfully present within our human openness."
          </h1>
          <p>
            This is a significant quote as it paints a critical human emotion in a different light: the feeling of nothing.
            Feeling nothing is usually viewed negatively as if it is a bad emotion to experience. But this quote paints it as 
            a vital emotion which guides to the things we love. And as a result, we feel re-energized and happy as we are spending
            time with the things we want once more.
